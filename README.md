# Diabeathis
A simple insulin calculator app for diabetics.
This app was designed, developed, and distributed by Tiwong Nance, Jr.


Q. How did you come up with the idea?
A. Diabetic since January 2013. Each day, I had to calculate my carbs, blood sugar, etc. 
in order to get my insulin doses. The app would make calculations easier. 
I still recommend doing them manually, but it saves a hassle.

Q. Why did you make this app?
A. I wanted to help other diabetics have easier lives. 

Q. Why is it free?
A. Medical expenses are expensive enough, and I'm not looking to make money from it.
Just trying to make the world a better places.
